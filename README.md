*“Consumer data will be the biggest differentiator in the next two to three years. Whoever
unlocks the reams of data and uses it strategically will win.”* - Above quote by Senior Vice President at Apple and former CEO at Burberry Angela Ahrendts, a leading figure in the retail and merchandising management, highlights the importance of data science and analytics in the retail industry. With every single click, data is growing at lightning pace. It is slated to become the most valuable commodity in the
