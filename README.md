Identify the scope, applications and methods used for Customer preference analysis in retail industry using Data Analytical methods
“Consumer data will be the biggest differentiator in the next two to three years. Whoever
unlocks the reams of data and uses it strategically will win.”
Above quote by Senior Vice President at Apple and former CEO at Burberry Angela
Ahrendts, a leading figure in the retail and merchandising management, highlights the
importance of data science and analytics in the retail industry. With every single click, data is
growing at lightning pace. It is slated to become the most valuable commodity in the
forthcoming century and organizations are expected to dive in and exploit data to thrive in
today’s cutthroat business environment.
The industry focuses on selling goods and services to customers for their business,
personal or household needs. Purchasing goods and services is largely influenced by the
expectations and preferences of consumers. In this endeavor to cater to user needs and anticipate
demand, businesses are obligated to enhance the overall user experience and personalize as per
the individual needs. Customer retention can be improved by ensuring that customers view and
receive their preferred products that meet their specifications and expectations.
Under this project, we intend to understand the various tools and methods used to analyze
and understand customer preferences by the retail industry. Furthermore, we expect to learn the
scope for data analytics and skills on demand in this ever - evolving business environment. For
the analysis of customer preference, the retailer should have a recommendation system and filter
results based on the collected data about the customer. The customer lifetime value is a factor
that influences the need for recommendation for that particular customer. It is the analysis of the
revenue a customer generates for the retailer. There are numerous parameters that help assess
and gauge the customer behavior, currently utilized in the retail industry.
From our research we were able to comprehend the steps involved in customer preference
analysis. It starts with data collection, data ingestion along with validation. This is where Big
Data comes into play, since it has the capacity to process massive amounts of structured and
unstructured data. The collection needs to be highly curated and well supervised as it can
adversely influence the outcome. The data may not be all-encompassing or recorded in an
accurate manner. The forthcoming data such as customer, product usage or promotion data, is
stored in multiple repositories in varied formats based on the data architecture.
During data ingestion, the data is fetched from multiple sources and converted to a
consistent format. For the initial steps, we narrowed down to tools available in Hadoop that
facilitate efficient data handling. After data ingestion, Data mining helps to effectively utilize the
data which has been collected. Cluster analysis uses a mathematical model to discover groups of
similar customers based on small variations among the customers in each group. Although it is a
relatively simple segmentation method, it efficiently generates and utilizes customer preference
prototypes that are already available. Machine learning methods such as SVM classification and
K-means clustering are used in further analysis of customer preferences. The various methods we
explored are explained in detail.
